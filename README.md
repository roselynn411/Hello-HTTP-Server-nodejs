# Hello-HTTP-Server-nodejs
 In this project, I will build a very simple web server that will only respond to a basic request for http://localhost:8080/.


This project pass all the following Criteria

1.Server should respond to GET (browser url) requests to http://localhost:8080/ with the text "Hello World"
2.Server should respond with a status code of 200
3.Server should log each request path (e.g. / or /test) at the standard out (console)
4.Server should indicate when it is listening and on which port
5.All tests should pass
